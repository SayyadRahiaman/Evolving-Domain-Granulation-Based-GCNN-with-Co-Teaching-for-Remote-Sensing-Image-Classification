# Linked-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-Vector-Map-Generation-using-Remote-Sensing-Images-
 This project proposes Linked Generative Adversarial Networks (LGANs) to generate accurate vector maps from remote sensing images across different domains. LGANs extract global (polygons), local (lines), and sub-local (points) features, improving accuracy compared to existing GAN-based mapping models. This repository contains the implementaion, training and testing code for this network.

## Pretrained Weights
